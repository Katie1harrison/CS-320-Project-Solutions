Here you'll find I uploaded my solutions to the projects.

A short description of the projects:

P1: Python Review, Git Analysis, Benchmarking

P2 Loan Analysis:  meant for us to practice creating classes, working with large datasets, using trees, and writing tests and modules

P3 Find the Path: Allowed us to practice inheritance, graph search, and web scraping

P4 Building a Data Website: learned how to create a website that imported data, interacted with vistors, and displayed graphs of data comparisons

P5 EDGAR Web Logs: learned how to compress large amounts of data and use it later for analysis

P6 Regression Models: made predictions based on regression models

P7 Selling Laptops: Smart Marketing: this project was more open ended, we had to create a classifer using some combination of the given data and any type of Regression and pipline we wanted.
