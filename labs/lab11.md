# DRAFT!  Don't start yet.

# Lab 11

Activities:

1. Share with your group, *what is your favorite Python module, and why?*  It could be something we use in 320, or something you learned elsewhere.

2. Debugging Practice: inside your `s22` repo, there is a `labs/debug/8-geo/main.ipynb`.  Try to fix the bugs.  There is a `solution.ipynb` too, but only peek as a last resort!

3. Use a LinearRegression to [predict how long](./regression) it will take to run a piece of code

4. remember that each study group member **who attended in-person** should fill the TopHat question: https://app.tophat.com/e/594996
